### Game Of Tolerance

Hi my name is Phillip Tham and I am a developer. Welcome to the Game of Tolerance, a python program that simulates a variant of Texas Hold Em. I built this program to showcase the following skills:
1. Python with object orientated programming
2. Understanding of basic source control flow(add,commit, push,merge, pull)
3. Markdown README
4. Git tags and releases
